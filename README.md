# ONE_versus_ALL
My mistakes, which I may someday correct:
- [ ] used "vector" everywhere, although I could use more simple structure
- [ ] not used range-based "for" loop in some functions
- [ ] not used "const" and "noexcept" functions
- [ ] many mistakes in arguments of functions
- [ ] used raw-pointers, not smart
- [ ] save of game in simple text file (it will be better to do a database or serialization)
